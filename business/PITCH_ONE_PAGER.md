# NoteNest Pitch One-Pager

**Homepage pitch:**
NoteNest turns messy clinical notes into safe, shareable summaries—offline by default. It protects sensitive details using placeholders and outputs two views: a Patient View for understanding and a Clinician View (SOAP or 5C’s) for fast decisions. Cloak Mode adds scan/protect/report workflows for safe sharing.

## Why now
The AI era increases note volume and sharing needs, while privacy standards tighten. Teams need **offline, deterministic** tooling that protects sensitive data without relying on paid APIs.

## Key features
- **Summarize & Structure:** Patient View + Clinician View (SOAP / 5C’s)
- **Cloak Mode:** Scan, protect, and report for safe sharing
- **Offline-first:** No network calls, deterministic placeholders

## Pricing model (concept)
- **Free:** Demo + local CLI
- **Pro:** Individual license with templates and export options
- **Services:** Clinic onboarding, customization, and training

## How it works
1) Normalize messy notes
2) Protect sensitive fields with placeholders
3) Extract structured fields
4) Render patient + clinician outputs
